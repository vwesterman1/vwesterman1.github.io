			Due Process Clause and Climate Change Legal Memo
			</a>
			</h4>
		<div class="Description of the paper">
		For my environmental law class I was assigned a relevant subject in this field and was then expected to write a legal memo to a hypothetical attorney. I was given the overlapping topics of the Due Process Clause and climate change. Using constitutional interpretations and prior case law of cases such as Roe v. Wade and Obergefell v. Hodges, as well as more environmentally related cases like Juliana v. United States, I argued that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments can be used to address the harms of climate change.

			Policy Memo Addressing Climate Change in Alaska
			</a>
			</h4>
		<div class="Description of the paper">
		In my Intro to Environmental Science and Policy course a required assignment was to write a policy memo concerning a topic of our choice to a potential supervisor that we may have in the future. Given my interest in the impacts of climate change on EJ communities in Alaska, as well as the implications of melting sea ice in this area, I chose to write to the Governor of Alaska. In this paper, I improved on my ability to convey scientific and political points in a cohesive manner.

			Research Paper of the Purple Line
			</a>
			</h4>
		<div class="Description of the paper">
		As a part of my major, I was required to complete an internship and then write a research paper relating to my experience. During my time at MDE, I had the opportunity to observe the NEPA process for numerous projects. The process of EIS’s was one of interest to me. 
		Given this and the local impacts and implications, I chose to analyze the Purple Line project. This paper challenged me to pursue a different style of writing, one that was more analytical and academic. In my future I look forward to utilizing this writing style to pursue other research topics in the field of environmental science and policy.
